The bottom of the dialog contains the standard Next and Back buttons.",align=center]

All UI Tours must be assigned the *Education > Onboarding* Guide Category.

NOTE: You must configure the <<styling,>>, <<location,>> and <<behavior,>> settings for each Step in a UI Tour.

[#styling]
=== Styling 

Use the following guidelines for Styling settings.

|====
| Setting | Description 

| Theme 
| Do not change the Theme for a UI Tour without a good reason and express permission. 

| Step 1 Name
a| Add a name to each Step for a UI Tour. 

Try to provide a descriptive name that describes what element of the UI you're showing in that Step.

For example, `Bucket list`.

| Caret
| If your UI Tour Step is positioned relative to an element, enable the Caret.

| Backdrop
| For every Step except the first and final Steps of a UI tour, enable the Backdrop. 

| Show target element above backdrop
| If *Backdrop* is enabled, always enable *Show target element above backdrop*. 

| Close Button 
| Enable the Close Button. 

| Dimensions 
| You should not need to change the default Width dimension for a UI Tour Step. 

| ARIA Label - Accessible Name
a| Use your Step Name to provide an accessible name for the UI Tour Step, with the phrase `helper dialog`. 

For example, `Bucket list helper dialog`.

| Role 
| Leave the Role as *Dialog*. 

| Autofocus this Step 
| Leave *Autofocus this step* enabled.

| ARIA Label - Close Button 
| Leave as `Close`.
|====

[#location]
=== Location 

Use the following guidelines for Location settings. 

|====
| Setting | Description 

| Position On Page 
a| Position on Page depends on the UI Tour Step:

* First Step: *Relative to Element* or *Bottom Right Aligned*
* Subsequent Step: *Relative to Element*
* Final Step: *Centered* 

| Offset
| For *Bottom Right Aligned* steps, leave the Offset as 20px by 20px. 

| Position to Element (Relative to Element Steps Only)
| Use *Auto*, or choose the location that provides the best visual result.
Make sure the Step is fully visible and legible. 

| Anchor To Element (Relative to Element Steps Only)
a| The *Suggested Match* option after you select an element with *Anchor To Element* will rarely be specific enough for reliable Guide display. You will need to edit the CSS with the *Custom CSS* option. 

For some tips on syntax to try and use for targeting, see https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031863612-What-CSS-selectors-are-supported-for-feature-tagging-[Using CSS Selectors in Feature Tagging].

Usually, this should be *Only on this page*.

Some Guides may need to be displayed *Sitewide*.

== Guide Content 

Use the following guidelines for developing Guide content. 

=== Progress Tracker 

Every UI Tour Guide should contain a progress tracker at the top of the Guide dialog. 

TIP: Finalize the progress tracker when you're finished designing the rest of your guide. 

Fill in the template with the Step number the user is currently on, out of the total number of Steps, for each Step.

For example, `STEP 1 OF 10`.

Write in all capital letters, for aesthetic reasons.

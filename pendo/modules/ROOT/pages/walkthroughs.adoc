Use the following guidance to write text for a Walkthrough Guide. 

A Walkthrough takes a user through a series of Steps to complete a specific task in the UI:

The body text states 'Provide a brief instruction or explanation about this Step or feature in the walkthrough. What can the user do or achieve with this?' The bottom of the dialog contains the standard Next and Back buttons.",align=center]

[#guide-name]
== Guide Name

Start the Guide Name with *Walkthrough -*. 

Use the Guide Goal that you identified when writing your Guide Plan to create the Guide Name.

== Guide Layout 

Use the following layouts based on the Step you need to create in the Walkthrough Guide: 

* First Step
* Next Step

== Guide Category 

All Walkthroughs must be assigned the *Education > Onboarding* Guide Category. 

== Guide Settings 

Use the following guidelines for Walkthrough Guide settings. 

NOTE: You must configure the <<styling,>>, <<location,>> and <<behavior,>> settings for each Step in a Walkthrough.

[#styling]
=== Styling 

Use the following guidelines for Styling settings.

|====
| Setting | Description 

| Theme 
| Do not change the Theme for a Walkthrough without a good reason and express permission. 

| Step 1 Name
a| Add a name to each Step for a Walkthrough. 

Try to provide a descriptive name that describes what the user needs to do for that Step.

For example, `Set Query Context`.

| Caret
| If your Walkthrough Step is positioned relative to an element, enable the Caret.

| Backdrop
| Do not enable the Backdrop for a Walkthrough Step. 

| Close Button 
| Enable the Close Button. 

| Dimensions 
| You should not need to change the default Width dimension for a Walkthrough Step. 

| ARIA Label - Accessible Name
| Use your Step Name to provide an accessible name for the Walkthrough Step, with the phrase `helper dialog`. 
For example, `Set Query Context helper dialog`.

| Role 
| Leave the Role as *Dialog*. 

| Autofocus this Step 
| Leave *Autofocus this step* enabled.

| ARIA Label - Close Button 
| Leave as `Close`.
|====

[#location]
=== Location 

Use the following guidelines for Location settings. 

|====
| Setting | Description 

| Position On Page 
a| Position on Page depends on the Walkthrough Step:

* First Step: *Relative to Element* or *Bottom Right Aligned*
* Subsequent Step: *Relative to Element*
* Final Step: *Centered* 

| Offset
| For *Bottom Right Aligned* steps, leave the Offset as 20px by 20px. 

| Position to Element (Relative to Element Steps Only)
| Use *Auto*, or choose the location that provides the best visual result.
Make sure the Step is fully visible and legible. 

| Anchor To Element (Relative to Element Steps Only)
a| The *Suggested Match* option after you select an element with *Anchor To Element* will rarely be specific enough for reliable Guide display. You will need to edit the CSS with the *Custom CSS* option. 

For some tips on syntax to try and use for targeting, see https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031863612-What-CSS-selectors-are-supported-for-feature-tagging-[Using CSS Selectors in Feature Tagging].

| Page Location
a| Set according to the needs of the Walkthrough. 

Usually, this should be *Only on this page*.

Some Guides may need to be displayed *Sitewide*.

[#behavior]
=== Behavior

Use the following guidelines for Step Behavior. 

|====
| Setting | Description

| Close Button 
| Do not change or remove the Close Button action.

| Advance on Element Click 
a| The actions for a Step depend on the purpose of the Step: 

* If the user must put text or another input into the current UI element to complete the next Steps in your Walkthrough, delete the *Advance on Element Click* action.
Keep all other actions. 

* If the user must click the current element UI to complete the next Steps in your Walkthrough, keep the *Advance on Element Click* action and delete all other actions.

Keep all other actions.

|====

== Guide Content 

Use the following guidelines for developing Guide content. 

=== Progress Tracker 

Every Walkthrough Guide should contain a progress tracker at the top of the Guide dialog. 

TIP: Finalize the progress tracker when you're finished designing the rest of your guide. 

Fill in the template with the Step number the user is currently on, out of the total number of Steps, for each Step.

For example, `STEP 1 OF 10`.

Write in all capital letters, for aesthetic reasons.

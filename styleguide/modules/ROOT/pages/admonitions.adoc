= Admonitions 

Antora has 5 admonition types: 

. <<notes,Note>>
. <<tips,Tip>>
. <<warnings,Warning>>
. <<cautions,Caution>>
. <<importants,Important>> 

Do not use more than two admonitions back-to-back on a page, and do not overuse them. 

Remember: if everything is important, nothing is. 

TIP: If you need to add block or "compound" content to an admonition block, use a compound admonition, as described in the https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/basics.html#admonitions[Contributing to the Documentation Guide].

[#notes]
== Notes

Use a note when you:

* Want to tell the user something that's not critical. 
* Want the user to keep something in mind while working through a procedure.
* Want to highlight a specific point in a concept. 

For example: 

NOTE: If you used the default installation for Couchbase Server, you can find the command line clients inside your installation. 

NOTE: The document key must be unique for each document you insert. 

Use other admonition types, like <<cautions,cautions>> and <<warnings,warnings>> for critical information. 

[#tips]
== Tips 

Use a tip when you: 

* Want to tell the user about a shortcut or faster way of accomplishing a task. 
* Want to tell the user about something optional. 
* Want to let the user know something that's useful, but isn't considered that important. 

You should also use a tip to let a user know when they can also accomplish a task from the API as well as the UI.
Make sure to provide a link to the API documentation as well as the specific method, call, or class the user should use. 

For example: 

TIP: The maximum allowed value is 2147483648 seconds (68.096 years). 

TIP: You can also press kbd:[ENTER] to submit your query.

You can also foo the bar from the xref:admonitions.adoc#tips[Public Management API]: 

* xref:admonitions.adoc#tips[`FOO`]

[#warnings]
== Warnings 
 
Use a warning when you: 

* Need to tell the user about something that could cause data loss or irreversible damage. 
* Need to tell the user about an irreversible action or critical piece of information. 

For example:

WARNING: Dropping a bucket is an irreversible action. You canot recover the data from a dropped bucket. 

WARNING: A deleted repository and its back-up data cannot be recovered.

[#cautions]
== Cautions

Use a caution when you: 

* Need to tell the user that the code described or provided has not been extensively tested.
* Need to tell the user about something that might cause an error. 

For example:

CAUTION: *Memcached* buckets are deprecated. Use a *Couchbase* or *Ephemeral* bucket, instead.

CAUTION: You must modify the default number of replicas for a bucket. 
Otherwise, all key-value writes with durability enabled will fail. 

[#importants]
== Important 

Use an important when you: 

* Need to tell the user about something that's changed across versions and does not work the same way.

Try to use an important at the top of a page or section. 

For example:

IMPORTANT: In version 3.3 of the .NET SDK, `foo` no longer requires the `bar` parameter.

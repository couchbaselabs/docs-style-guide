= Anchor Links

If you need to link to a specific place in a page, whether from another page or on the same page, use an anchor link. 

NOTE: Don't rely on Antora's automatically generated anchor links. 
If you need to use an anchor link, create your own. 
This prevents broken links if header content changes. 

When creating an anchor link:

* Keep the anchor link short and descriptive. 
Aim for no more than 3-5 words maximum.
* Make sure that your anchor links are unique across the page. 
* Use all lowercase letters. 
* Separate words with dashes. 
* Don't add punctuation. 

For example, an anchor link for the heading *Generate API Keys* could be `[#generate-api-keys]`.

As well, make sure you're using the right anchor link style for the type of anchor you want to create: 

|====

|Element |Required Anchor Link Style 

|Headers |`[#anchor-link]`

|Full tables |`[#anchor-link]`

|Lists |`[#anchor-link]`

|Other block elements |`[#anchor-link]`

|Table entries |`\[[anchor-link]]`

|Inline text |`\[[anchor-link]]`

|====

Then, use the right kind of link: 

* For linking to an anchor from another page: `xref:name-of-page.adoc#anchor-link`
* For linking to an anchor on the same page: `\<<anchor-link,Link Text>>`

= Button Macro

Use the Antora `btn:` Macro for buttons and named items that the user clicks in the UI. The button can be inside the step for a procedure, but the text doesn't need to be in a procedure to use the macro. 

For example, `btn:[Submit]` renders a Submit button.

The following UI elements are considered buttons: 

* Any clickable element that opens a dialog or pane. 
* Any clickable element that causes an action to happen. 
* Any clickable element that contains an icon.

NOTE: A button might or might not have a defined border and color.

When you need to describe a button in the UI: 

* Refer to the button by its name only. Don't add "button."
+
For example, *Submit*.

* Use the `btn:[]` macro to format the button. 

If a clickable element changes the screen or navigates the user away from their current location in the UI, use the xref:menu-ui-macro.adoc[Menu UI Macro], instead.

= Capitalization 

Capitalize the following: 

* The first word of every sentence. 

* Proper nouns. 

* The days of the week, months of the year, and holidays.

* The names of countries, nationalities, and languages. 

* Trademarks.

* SQL and SQL++ clauses. 

Follow the official capitalization for brand names, companies, software, products, services, features, and other terms defined by companies or open-source communities. 

Don't use unnecessary capitalization. 
Don't use all-uppercase letters except for official names, abbreviations, or referencing code that uses all caps. 

Don't use camel case, unless the name or code you're referencing uses it. 

For capitalization rules for specific terms, refer to the xref:word-list.adoc[].

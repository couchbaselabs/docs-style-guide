= Colons and Semi-Colons

Use the following guidance for when to add a colon or semi-colon to your text. 

== Colons

Use colons to introduce examples, such as an image or a code block, in your text. 

Use a colon to introduce an ordered or unordered list. 

== Semi-Colons

Try to avoid using a semi-colon. In most cases, a period and a pair of shorter sentences is fine. 

If you're using a semi-colon to separate complex items in a list, just change the list to an ordered or unordered list. 

Otherwise, try to follow the Google Developer Style Guide's https://developers.google.com/style/semicolons[guidance on semi-colons].

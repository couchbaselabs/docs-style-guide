= Dashes

You can use two types of dashes in Couchbase documentation: an en dash or an em dash. 

== Em Dashes 

Use an em dash (—) to set off an aside or comment in your text. 
Don't use parentheses. 
Don't use an en dash or hyphen.

For example, `an em dash is a great piece of punctuation — but it can be easily overused`.

== En Dashes 

Use an en dash (–) to represent a range of numbers, dates, or time. 

For example, `choose a number in the range of 1–4`.

== Hyphens 

Use hyphens (-) to join words together, such as compound adjectives. 
A compound adjective is two or more words that collectively modify a noun. 

For example, `full-text search`.

= Data Insights Area

The Data Insights area appears to the left of the controls for the different *Data Tools* in the Couchbase Capella UI. 

It has buttons to add a bucket and import data:

When you need to describe the Data Insights area in the UI: 

* Capitalize Data Insights, but don't add bold. 
Don't bold or capitalize the word "area."

* Top-level items are *buckets*, followed by *collections*, then *scopes*, then *schemas*.

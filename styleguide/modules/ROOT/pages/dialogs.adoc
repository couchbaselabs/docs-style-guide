= Dialogs 

A dialog is any distinct floating window that displays inside the main application. 

A dialog might grey out or dim the rest of the application when it appears.

You can dismiss a dialog or complete its associated action to close it. 
You can't do anything else in the application until you close the dialog. 

For example, for the *Create a new project* dialog, you must dismiss the dialog or enter a project name and select *[Create Project]*:

When you need to describe a dialog in the UI: 

* Refer to the dialog by its name, followed by the word "dialog."
+
For example, the *Create a new project* dialog.

* Use the title of the dialog as it appears in the UI, where possible. This includes matching capitalization.

* Bold the dialog name. Don't bold the word "dialog."

= Dropdowns/Lists

A dropdown is a UI element that presents a list of options to a user, and lets them select one or more options. 

It usually appears as a box with a defined border and an expanding arrow in the UI:

When you need to describe a dropdown in the UI: 

* Refer to the dropdown by its name, followed by the word "list."
+
For example, the *Bucket* list. 
* Bold the dropdown name. 
* Tell the user to "select x in the list."
+
For example, in the *Bucket* list, select a bucket.

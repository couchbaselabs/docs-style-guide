= Code Examples

Add code examples where possible to show users how to work with Couchbase products. 

When adding a code example: 

Do:: 
+
* Make it relevant and applicable to your explanation. 
* Make sure it is a working code sample that the user could use in their own projects. 
* Put the code example in its own separate file.
* Use the correct format for xref:placeholders.adoc[].
Don't::
+ 
* Include cultural references. 
* Write the code sample directly inside the .adoc file. 

== Introducing Examples 

Use the following guidelines for adding an example into your documentation: 

* Don't use directional language to describe where in the text your example is, like "above" or "below." 
Use "preceding," "previous," or "following."

* Similar to xref:links.adoc[links], use "see."

* Use a colon at the end of the phrase you use to introduce your example.

== Adding a Code Example 

Antora supports two different methods of inserting smaller blocks of code into a page: 

* Add tags inside code comments to mark the code to include. 
* Choose specific line numbers to include.

=== Tags 

To start a code sample, in the source code file, add `tag::<TAG_NAME>[]` in a code comment before the lines of code you want to include. 

To end a code sample, in the source code file, add `end::<TAG_NAME>[]` in a code comment following the lines of code you want to include. 

For example, the following code has two tags, `using` and `connect`: 

[source, c#]
----
using System;
// #tag::using[]
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Couchbase;
// #end::using[]

namespace examples
{
    class StartUsing
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {

            // #tag::connect[]
             var cluster = await Cluster.ConnectAsync("couchbase://localhost", "username", "password");
            // #end::connect[]
        
        ...
        }
    }
}
----

=== Line Numbers 

To include a specific set of lines of code in your code, use the `lines` attribute inside your include directive. 

For example, the following code would include lines 1-3 of the code file `select-true-alias-get-business-days.n1ql`: 

----
\include::example$javascript-udfs/select-true-alias-get-business-days.n1ql[lines=1..3]
----

For more information about how to include specific lines of content, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-lines/[Include Content by Line Ranges] in the Asciidoctor Documentation.

== Explaining Code Examples

Avoid the https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/code-blocks.html#callouts[built-in code callouts] in Antora, where possible. 

Use small code examples with the explanation in regular text around the example. Add one-line code comments directly to the code where appropriate to explain the assumptions made in a code example. 

Let the user know they should remove the comments to use the code in a production environment.

When you need to explain a larger code example: 

. Show the full example and provide a brief explanation. 
. Create a smaller code example out of the larger block of code. 
. Provide a more detailed explanation for the smaller code example. 
. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you've explained the code.

= Keyboard Macro

Use the Antora `kbd:` Macro for any keyboard interactions in your documentation. The key press can be inside the step for a procedure, but the text doesn't need to be in a procedure to use the macro. 

For example, `kbd:[ESC]` renders an Escape key.

For more information on how to use the Keyboard Macro to format your documentation, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/basics.html#ui-macros[Button, Keyboard, and Menu UI Macros] in the Contributing to the Documentation guide.

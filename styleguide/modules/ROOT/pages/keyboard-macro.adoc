= Keyboard Macro

Use the Antora `kbd:[]` Macro for any keyboard interactions in your documentation. 
The key press can be inside the step for a procedure, but the text does not need to be in a procedure to use the macro. 

For example, `\kbd:[ESC]` renders an Escape key (kbd:[ESC]).

For more information about how to use the Keyboard Macro to format your documentation, see xref:home:contribute:basics.adoc#ui-macros[Button, Keyboard, and Menu UI Macros] in the Contributing to the Documentation guide.

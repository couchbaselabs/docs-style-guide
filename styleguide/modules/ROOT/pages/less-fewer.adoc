= Less vs. Fewer

Use *less* for uncountable or mass nouns. 

Use *fewer* for nouns that you can count. 

== Less 

Use *less* for quantities that are measured rather than counted:

* Less time
* Less effort

You can't count effort or time (without using units like minutes or hours), so use *less*. 

However, there are exceptions: 

* Use less for distances (less than 3 kilometers)
* Use less for sums of money (less than 50 dollars)
* Use less for units of time and weight (less than 7 years, less than 10 pounds)
* Use less for statistics (less than 2,000 people)

== Fewer 

Use *fewer* for things that can be counted or have a number attached to them: 

* Fewer databases 
* Fewer indexes
* Fewer status updates

You can count the number of databases, indexes, or status updates, so use *fewer*.

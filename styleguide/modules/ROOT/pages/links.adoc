= Links

Follow the https://developers.google.com/style/link-text[Google Developer Style Guide^]'s guidance on how to write link text. In general, make it clear where a user ends up after they click a link. 

NOTE: This doesn't mean to just use the URL as the displayed link text. Try to write effective and useful link text for all links.

Keep the following formatting and conventions in mind for <<internal>> and <<external>> in the Couchbase Documentation. 

[#internal]
== Internal Links 

Use the `xref` syntax for all links to content within the documentation repositories. For more information about the `xref` syntax in Antora, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/cross-references.html[Cross References^] in the Contributing to the Documentation guide.

You can leave the link text for an `xref` blank to get Antora to use the <h1> heading of the linked page as the link.

=== SDK References and API References

Where possible, when linking to an SDK or API reference, use an evergreen link. Evergreen links help cut down on maintenance when tooling for references and other resources change. For a list of evergreen links, see the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-site/blob/master/etc/nginx/snippets/rewrites.conf[rewrites.conf file^]. 

Format evergreen links as external links. For an example of using an evergreen link, see the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-java/release/3.3/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[entries in the References section in the nav.adoc file^] for the Java SDK documentation.

[#external]
== External Links

For links to third-party websites, follow the guidance in https://developers.google.com/style/links-external[Links to other sites^] in the Google Developer Style Guide. Use their guidance for when and how to link.

For more information about external link syntax in Antora, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/basics.html#urls[URLs^] in the Contributing to the Documentation guide.

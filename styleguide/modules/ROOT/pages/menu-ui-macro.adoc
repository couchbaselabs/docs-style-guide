= Menu UI Macro

Use Antora's Menu UI Macro to render any menu navigation in your documentation. 

For example, `menu:File[Save]` renders as *File > Save* in the Couchbase Documentation.

The menu navigation can be inside the step for a procedure, but the text doesn't need to be in a procedure to use the macro. 

The following situations are considered menu navigation: 

* Any selections a user makes that causes a significant change to the base contents of a page.
* Any selections a user makes that brings the user to a new page. 

More specifically, selections made in the following UI elements use the Menu UI Macro: 

* Any sequence of xref:tabs.adoc[tab] and xref:menus.adoc[menu] navigation.
+
For example, if you instruct the user to select the *Data Tools* tab and then the *Buckets* menu item.
* The Profile menu. 
* Any hamburger or *More* menu (&#8942; or ...).

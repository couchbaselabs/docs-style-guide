= Menus

A menu is a sequence of named clickable UI elements. 
Menus display vertically in the UI. 

Menus never appear horizontally - those are xref:tabs.adoc[].

Like a tab, a menu changes the information that's displayed the UI. This could be for the whole application, or for a specific section. 

The UI highlights the currently selected menu item for the user. 

For example, the following is the *Data Tools* menu, as it appears when the user selects the *Data Tools* tab:

When you need to describe a menu in the UI: 

* Refer to the menu by its name, followed by the word "menu."
+
For example, the *Data Tools* menu.

* Refer to the menu item by its name only. Don't add "menu item."
+
For example, *Query*.

* Bold the menu name or menu item. 

* If you need to tell the user to select a menu item after they select a xref:tabs.adoc[tab], use the xref:menu-ui-macro.adoc[], instead.

= Monospace Font (Highlighted)

Use the highlighted monospace font to format: 

* Any code that appears outside of a code block. 
* N1QL/SQL++ commands and function names.
* API methods, classes, and calls.  
* File paths and filenames. 
* Any text a user needs to input. 

Surround text with backticks (`) to make the text render in highlighted monospace in Antora. For more information, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/basics.html#bold-italic-and-code-styles[Bold, Italic, and Code Styles] in the Contributing to the Documentation guide.

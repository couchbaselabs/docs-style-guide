= Numbers 

Contrary to the https://developers.google.com/style/numbers[Google Style Guide^], Couchbase style writes all numbers, regardless of size, as numerals instead of words.

Always use the numeral, no matter the size of the number.

For example: 

* `1 or more`
* `2-day total`
* `3-node cluster`

= Only

Put *only* as close to the object you're trying to modify as possible. 

The placement of the word *only* can change the meaning of the sentence: 

* *Only* deploy a Capella database this month. (Don't do anything else with the database)
* Deploy *only* a Capella database this month. (Don't deploy another type of database)
* Deploy a Capella database *only* this month. (Don't do anything else this month)
* Deploy a Capella database this month *only*. (Don't deploy a database any other time)

Think carefully about what you're trying to say and put *only* in the correct place to modify your sentence.

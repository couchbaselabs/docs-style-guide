= Options

An option is a selectable UI element. 
It represents a choice the user has to make between two or more distinct options. 

An option can display in the UI as: 

* A selectable "card"

* A radio button 

An option is not a list, checkbox, or text box. 

The UI highlights the currently selected option for the user.

For example, the *Select a cloud provider* and *In region* cards are options:

When you need to describe an option in the UI: 

* When you need to describe the whole option set, refer to the set by its name, followed by the word option. 
Always make sure to describe the available options to the user.
You can also link to documentation that describes the different options, rather than describing inside the procedure.
+
For example, "Select a *Plan* option."

* When you need to tell the user to select a specific option, use the name of the specific option. 
Don't use the word "option."
+
For example, "Under *Plan*, select *Basic*."

* Bold the name for the set of options and the specific option the user must select.

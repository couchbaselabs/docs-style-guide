= Tables

Use a table to show the relationships between information. 

For example, use a table to list out properties or options and describe them: 

|====
|Option |Description

|Type Identifier a|

Set a type identifier to change how an index sets a document's type.

For more information about how to set a type identifier, see Set a Type Identifier.

To add a table: 

* Introduce the table with a phrase that describes its contents and ends in a colon. For example, "the following default options are available:"
* Add a vertical bar (|) followed by 4 equals signs (=) to mark the start and end of your table. 
* After the first `|====`, on a new line, add another vertical bar (|) and your first column name. 
* Make column names short but descriptive. 
* Group rows by entering all content on the same line, separated by vertical bars (|), or by entering the content for a row in a block separated by whitespace. For example: 
+
----
|====
|Header Row, Column 1 |Header Row, Column 2

|First Row, Column 1 |First Row, Column 2

|Second Row, Column 1
|Second Row, Column 2
|====
----
* If your table has more than 2 columns, you must set the proportional width of each column with the `[cols=""]` attribute before the opening `|====` for your table. For example, if a table with 4 columns had `[cols="1,1,1,2"]`, the last column would be 2Ã— the width of all the other columns.

= Tabs

A tab is a named clickable element in the UI.
It appears in a horizontal sequence of other tabs. 

Tabs never appear vertically. 

A tab changes the information that's displayed the UI. This could be for the whole application, or for a specific section. 

The UI highlights the currently selected tab for the user. 

For example, the following are both tabs: 

====
image::tab-example.png[,,align=center]
====

====
image::tab-example-2.png[,,align=center]
====

When you need to describe a tab in the UI: 

* Refer to the tab by its name, followed by the word tab. 
+
For example, the *Data Tools* tab.

* Bold the tab name. 

* If you need to tell the user to select a xref:menus.adoc[Menu item] after they select a tab, use the xref:menu-ui-macro.adoc[], instead.

NOTE: A user selects a tab to open a page in the UI. For more information, see xref:pages.adoc[].

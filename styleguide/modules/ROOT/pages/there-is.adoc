= There + To Be

Don't start a sentence with "there" and a form of the verb "to be":

* There is 
* There are 
* There were 
* There was 

These constructions hide the true subject and verb of the sentence, resulting in weaker writing. 

== How To Avoid There Is

To avoid the "there is" construction, try: 

* To remove "there is."
* To move the true subject and verb from the end of the sentence.
* To create a subject for the sentence. 

For example: 

----
There are multiple variables that store the result.

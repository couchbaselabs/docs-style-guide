= Toggles 

A toggle is a UI element that turns a specific feature on or off. 
It changes visually to indicate when it's turned on or off. 

It appears as a small switch in the UI:

When you need to describe a toggle in the UI: 

* Refer to the toggle by its name, followed by the word "toggle."
+
For example, the *Transaction* toggle.

* Bold the toggle name. 

* Tell the user to "turn on" or "turn off" the toggle. 
+
For example, turn on the *Transaction* toggle.

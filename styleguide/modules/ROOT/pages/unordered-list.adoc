= Unordered Lists

Use an unordered or bulleted list when you have a collection of three or more things and the order of the items doesn't matter. These items could be nouns, phrases, or topics. 

If you only have two items in your list, it's okay to just write it out in a sentence. 

Use an unordered list when writing prerequisites or a See Also section in your documentation. Use an unordered list for prerequisites and the See Also section even if it contains only a single item. 

Use an asterix (*) to render an item as an unordered list item. The number of asterixes sets the depth of the list item.

= Unordered Lists

Use an unordered or bulleted list when you have a collection of three or more things and the order of the items does not matter. 
These items could be nouns, phrases, or topics. 

For example: 

****
* This is a list item
** This is a sub-item 
****

If you only have two items in your list, it's okay to just write it out in a sentence. 

Use an unordered list when:

* Writing a prerequisites section in your documentation. 
* Writing a See Also section in your documentation. 
* Structuring the `nav.adoc` file in a documentation module. 

NOTE: Use an unordered list for prerequisites and the See Also section even if it contains only a single item. 

Use an asterix (`*`) to render an item as an unordered list item. 
The number of asterixes sets the depth of the list item.

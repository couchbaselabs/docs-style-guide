= Action Buttons 

An action button is anything the user clicks that causes something to happen in the UI. 

Never surprise the user with what happens after they click a button. 
The result should be obvious from the button's text.

== Start with an Action Verb 

Start button text with an action verb that clearly describes what happens after the user clicks the button. 

For example, the button to create a project could say *Create Project*. 

NOTE: This is unnecessary if the action button is a navigation button. Name the page that the user navigates to, instead.

== Align the Button Text to the Surrounding Text

Make sure that the text you use on the button aligns to the surrounding text. 

For example, if the preceding text tells the user that they can delete their organization, the button should say *Delete Organization*, not *Remove Organization*. 

If the user is making a change that they need to save or cancel, the confirmation button should be *Save*, not *Apply* or *Update*.
But, try to make the action match the surrounding text.

== Keep It Between 3-5 Words

Do not add a lot of words to a single button, or it might not be obvious that it's a button to the user. 

Try to stick to 3-5 words. 

== Write Buttons in Title Case

Use title case for all button text. 
Capitalize nouns and verbs, but not prepositions and conjunctions.

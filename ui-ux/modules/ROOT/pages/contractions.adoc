= Contractions 

Contractions are combinations of at least two words. 
A contraction is made by omitting one or more letters from one word and adding it to the end of another word. 

Many contractions combine a verb and a pronoun. 

== Do Not Use Negative Contractions 

Do not use negative contractions, especially in warning or error messages. 

Any `verb + not` combination should be written out in full. 

For example, do not shorten `could not` to `couldn't`.

== Do Not Use Informal Contractions

Do not use informal contractions like "wanna" or "gonna".

== Do Not Use Complex Contractions 

Do not use complex contractions like: 

* could've 
* might've 
* must've 
* should've
* what'll
* what're
* what've
* we've
* who'd
* who'll
* who've
* would've 
* you've

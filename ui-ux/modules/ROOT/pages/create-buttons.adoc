= Create Buttons

Any button that creates or adds a new component to a user's database should: 

* Start with a plus sign (+), followed by the verb *Create*. 
* Clearly state the component that the user will create. 
* Appear only in the top-right, above the area of the UI that lists any previously created components.
* Use title case.

The button to create a new component should never appear below the text stating *No <component> found*.

For example, the button to create a project should appear as: 

image::CreateProjectButton.png["A blue button that says + Create Project",align="center"]

It should appear on the top-right of the table in the UI that lists any previously created projects.

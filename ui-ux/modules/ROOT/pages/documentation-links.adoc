= Documentation and External Resource Links

All links in the UI should provide sufficient context for the user, so they know where they will go after they click a link. 

It should never be a surprise where a user goes after they click a link in the UI. 

== Documentation Links

NOTE: The issue of documentation links will still need to be revisited at a future date.

To link out to documentation from inside the UI: 

* Do not just link directly to the documentation with no context. 
Add some introductory information to get the user started. 
For example, `A bucket contains scopes and collections.` 
* Invite the user to `Learn More`.
* Set the actual blue link text to `Learn More`.
* Use an external link icon at the end of `Learn More` to show that the user will navigate out of the UI.
* Do not put a period at the end of `Learn More`.

//* Do not just link directly to the documentation with no context.

//* Invite the user to `Read more in the Couchbase Documentation`.
//* Set the actual blue link text to *Couchbase Documentation*.
//* Add an external link icon at the end of *Couchbase Documentation* to show that the user will navigate out of the UI. 
//* Do not put a period at the end of *Couchbase Documentation*.

== External Resource Links

If you want to link to another external resource: 

* Do not just link directly to the resource with no context. 
Add some introductory information to get the user started. 
For example, `Use a JavaScript function to define a file filter.`
* Set the actual blue link text to the name of the resource. 
* Add an external link icon at the end of the link text to show that the user will navigate out of the UI. 
* Do not put a period at the end of the link text.

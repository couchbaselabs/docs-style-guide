[#american]
== Write in American English

Use American English spelling, not British or Canadian English. The Vale automated spellcheck uses an American English dictionary. 

If you need to check the spelling of a word, refer to the https://www.merriam-webster.com/[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition^].

[#present]
== Write in the Present Tense 

Try to write in present tense wherever possible. 

If you need to refer to something that's happened in the past or will happen in the UI, then using past or future tense is acceptable - but try to avoid it.

[#second]
== Write in Second Person 

Try to always directly address the user in your UI copy, with "you." 

Do not use any third person gendered pronouns.

You can use first-person in specific circumstances. 
For more information, see xref:first-person.adoc[].

A *Project Owner* can create, modify, and delete buckets. 
He/she can create a maximum of 30 buckets.

[#active]
== Use Active Voice 

Passive voice weakens your writing and can make it harder to parse meaning. 
Stick to the active voice as much as you can. 

Start sentences with verbs, or directly address the user to avoid passive voice.

=== Tips for Active Voice

Here are some tips to help you with active voice: 

* Think about what's actually _doing_ the action you're describing. Emphasize the actor. 
* Find or push back for more information if you can't identify the actor. Ask the developer what's actually doing what in a scenario. 
* If the sentence doesn't make sense in active voice or you lose the correct emphasis, you can use the passive voice.

For more information about active voice, see https://developers.google.com/style/voice[Active voice^] in the Google Developer Style Guide.

[#simple]
== Keep It Plain, Short, and Simple

Plain language means avoiding jargon or overly technical phrases when a simpler word works best. 

Always write in full and complete sentences outside of headings. 

Keep text short and to the point. 

Use contractions, with some exceptions. For more information, see xref:contractions.adoc[].

[#lowest]
== Write for the Lowest Common Denominator 

The golden rule for when to add UI copy or text is simple:

If a lower-level user would struggle or the required action isn't obvious, add the text.

We want our UI to be accessible to all users and should always aim to add text to reduce friction. 

[#critical]
== Explain What Is Critical 

Keep to the most critical and important information when adding UI copy. 

Lengthy explanations or unusual situations should be explained in the documentation, not the UI. 

[#can-do]
== Focus on What the User Can Do 

When writing an xref:error-messages.adoc[error message] or any kind of text guiding a user away from an action, do not reveal or focus on their lack of permissions. 

Focus on what the user can do in their current situation, unless there's no other option than to ask an administrator about their permissions.


[#consistent]
== Keep It Consistent 

Keep the terminology that you use consistent across the UI. 

What's called a cluster in one part of the UI shouldn't be called a database elsewhere. 

[#numbers]
== Do Not Write Out Numbers 

Unlike technical documentation, UI copy should always use numerals for ease of recognition. Use 3 over three. 

Also aim to add units of measurement for numbers, where applicable. 

// [#sentence]
// == Use Sentence Case

// Use sentence case capitalization for UI text.

// Use title case only for xref:action-buttons.adoc[buttons].

// Headings should be in sentence case. 

// In general, find another visual way to add emphasis to text.

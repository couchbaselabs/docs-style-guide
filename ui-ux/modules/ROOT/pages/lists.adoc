= Lists and Menus

Lists can be: 

* Radio buttons 
* Navigation menus 
* Lists of checkboxes 
* Dropdowns 

== Use Parallelism and Consistency 

Make entries in a list parallel, as much as possible.
Parallel list entries follow the same structure, such as being all nouns or starting with a verb. 

Use consistent capitalization and other patterns. 

For example, the settings options for an organization could include *General* settings, *API Key* settings, *MFA* settings, *Session* settings, and an *Activity Log*. 

Don't sacrifice comprehension or understandability for parallelism. 

== Make Entries Mutually Exclusive 

Every option in a list should be mutually exclusive. 
There should be a clear difference between one list item and the next. 

== Use Good Instruction Text 

A user *enters* instead of *types*. 

A user *chooses* rather than *selects*. 

Do not tell the user to choose "from this dropdown list" in the instruction text. 
Just tell them what they need to choose.

= Prepositions 

Try to avoid using prepositions and creating lengthy, prepositional phrases in UI copy. 

Prepositions include: 

* at
* by
* for
* from
* in 
* of
* on
* with 

If you find yourself using one of these phrases in your copy, see if you can reword to avoid the phrase. 

Some prepositional phrases are okay, but you can end up with much clearer content without them.

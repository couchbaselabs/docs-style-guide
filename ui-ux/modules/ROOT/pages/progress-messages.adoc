= Progress Messages

Use a progress message to inform a user that a process has started. 

Try to be explicit about what's starting the process, or what the process is. 

If appropriate, use a verb ending in -ing to describe what the process is that's starting. 

For example: 

----
App Services is pausing Log Streaming.
----

== Avoid Specific Time Estimates

Never tell the user a specific time estimate for a process. 

Use a phrase like "This process might take several minutes to complete."

= Success Messages

A lot of our success messages tend to focus on a thing or task completing. 

== Use the Name of What Was Created
Where possible, try to be explicit about the name of the thing that was created. 

For example: 

----
Created Search index {INDEX_NAME}.
----

== Do Not Use "Successfully"

Avoid `successfully` or other adverbs ending in -ly to describe how something was done in the UI. 

Reword the success message to be more active and focus on the thing that was done. 

For example: 

----
Created backup.
----

----
Created new user {USER_NAME}.
----

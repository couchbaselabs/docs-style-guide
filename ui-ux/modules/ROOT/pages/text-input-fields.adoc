= Text Input Fields

A text input field is any field in the UI that a user can click into to enter text.

* Put a clear label above all text fields.
+
For example, if a user needs to enter a database name, put a label of *Database Name* on the text field. 
* Keep the xref:instruction-text.adoc[], or any elaboration on what the user should input in the text field, below the field, not inside.
+
For example, put any text about special character limitations or whether the value can be changed later below the text field.  
* Put a character limit counter at the bottom-right of the text field, outside the field itself, to indicate a character limit.
* Add useful hint text to show how a user should be inputting a value inside the text field. Have it disappear on its own when the user goes to type in the field.
+
For example, put an example database name inside the *Database Name* text field to show the user an example of what value they can enter.

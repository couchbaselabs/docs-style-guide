        description: |
          User is created via the Travel sample web app. When user is created, a corresponding user profile document is created on Couchbase Server.
        tryitout:
          - Launch travel sample web app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
          - Create a new user by entering "demo" as the username and "password" for the password. Make sure the "create new user" checkbox is selected.
          - You should be logged into the web app. There should be nothing created for the user.
          - Try it out 2
          - Open Couchbase Server at [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091).
          - Log in with Administrator credentials that you set up during the installation of Couchbase Server.
          - In the search box, enter "user:demo".
          - You should see the user document that was created when you signed up via the web app.
          - Enter the values you see in the "username" and "password" in the text fields below.
